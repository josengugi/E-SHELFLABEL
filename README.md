General Information
E-shelflabel is an electronic device compatible with arduino,mac os,windows 
server, android,linux and other unix like operating system and for windows.It uses 
LCD with I2C graphical user interface library.
The distribution also comes with with ATMEGA328 chipset hardware component 
that enables the reading and execution of the code.
Installation
The E-shelflabel project builds and test regularly on arduino software
but can also be tested on other several platforms without too much 
trouble.
You must therefore install arduino software to run and execute the 
code for any possible bugs.
Usage
E-shelflabel comes with multiple combination of a set of hardware that 
works together to execute the code(lcd with I2C,jumper cables,arduino 
uno/nano/mega).
The hardware which makes up the E-shelflabel works together to 
display the desired information.
It is a very low power hardware that runs on 5 volts when using the LCD 
display but when using the E-paper display it can continue showing the 
information even after a power outrage.
